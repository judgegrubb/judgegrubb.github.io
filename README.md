## This is a webpage I am building for my mother

I am using bootstrap and basic html/css/javascript skills to build out this webpage.

There is nothing spectacular going on here. If you take some code, just make sure you cite me [judgegrubb] as your source and I will not care at all.

As my mother once said:
>"Be kind to everyone and have a wonderful day!"
