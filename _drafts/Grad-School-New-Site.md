title: Some Thoughts...

It has been a while. How are you? I'm tired. It's almost 2am here.

I'm hoping to post more here now, both about Computer Science based topics and about other things that peak my interest.

### Grad School



Today I was reading [Ronald Azuma's "So long, and thanks for the Ph.D.!"](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html) and stumbled across this quote:

> I got the Ph.D. because I wanted to get a research position after leaving graduate school. I wanted to work with the state of the art and extend it. I did not want to “bring yesterday’s technology one step closer to tomorrow.” I wanted a job that would I find interesting, challenging and stimulating. While an M.S. would give me a chance at landing a research position, the Ph.D. would give me a much better chance. And I did not want to live with regrets. If I took the Doctoral Written Exam again and failed again, then I could say that it wasn’t meant to be and move on with my life. I would have no regrets because I had given it my best shot and was not able to make it. However, if I left with an M.S. without taking the test a second time, and five years later I was in a job that was boring and uninteresting, then I would have to lie awake every night for the rest of my life wondering “What if?” What if I had taken the test again and passed? Would I then be in the job that I really wanted? That was not a situation I wanted to be in. I did not want to live the rest of my life regretting what might have been.

This is the first time I've felt what I feel put down so accurately into words. This is the closest passage I've found to explaining my motivations behind why I want to get a PhD.

### Research Interests

### New Website

I spent most of the night tonight redesigning/rebuilding my [personal homepage](http://www.elijahgrubb.com). I wanted to build a page that would best help me in my path forward. I based the design off of [Andy Pavlo's site](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/), [Edward Yang's site](http://ezyang.com/), my old homepage and just the general design and organization I've seen PhD students use.
