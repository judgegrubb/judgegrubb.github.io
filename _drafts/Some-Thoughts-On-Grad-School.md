title: Some Thoughts... On Grad School
---

I remember the constant peppering my senior year of high school. "So what are you going to do once you graduate?"

It was annoying. It was stressful. Mormon culture wanted me to go on a mission, which I didn't really want. I had a couple options for schooling with different scholarships. I had to decide if I wanted to follow what was barely even a hobby at the time, software engineering, or pursue a path relating to my 3 years of debate experience. I was a heartbeat away from studying PoliSci or Economics. I'm still so grateful I found Computer Science on my first try. Many of my friends went down different paths before moving to the software world and while they're experiences have definitely built them up, I'm happy with my luck.

My poor sister and cousin. Both are seniors themselves in high school at the moment. Naturally, as much as I hated it when I was the victim, I've now become just as passionate a persecutor. As panick enducing as future planning was, the constant pressure gave me the kick I needed to stay on top of my life. Luckily both have great futures in store. My sister was recently offered a scholarship to play percussion at [Weber State](https://www.weber.edu/) and my cousin is finishing up an intro IT program at the [DATC](http://www.datc.edu/) before moving on to Weber State himself this fall.

Time marches on, continuously. Unfortunately, the future only gets longer and asks more questions then it answers.

When I decided to attend the University of Utah majoring in Computer Science, I thought I had made all my career decisions. My future was set and my path was clear. Yeah, that was foolish thinking. Careers are not a singular path to follow. It's a forest to cut through. There are times when you find clearings, or rivers to follow, but more often then not you're cutting through dense foliage, cursing and overworked. All of us looking for that place just right for us to settle.

Computer Science is a much broader subject then I expected leaving high school. And there is so much more to do then just be another basic software engineer at some company. So here I am, a rising senior about to enter my last year of my undergraduate degree, and I'm back where I was four years ago. Answering that same inane question. "So what are you going to do once you graduate?"

My answer has become, more and more surely, I am going to apply to grad schools in an attempt to pursue my PhD.

Today I was reading [Ronald Azuma's "So long, and thanks for the Ph.D.!"](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html) and stumbled across this quote:

> I got the Ph.D. because I wanted to get a research position after leaving graduate school. I wanted to work with the state of the art and extend it. I did not want to “bring yesterday’s technology one step closer to tomorrow.” I wanted a job that would I find interesting, challenging and stimulating. While an M.S. would give me a chance at landing a research position, the Ph.D. would give me a much better chance. And I did not want to live with regrets. If I took the Doctoral Written Exam again and failed again, then I could say that it wasn’t meant to be and move on with my life. I would have no regrets because I had given it my best shot and was not able to make it. However, if I left with an M.S. without taking the test a second time, and five years later I was in a job that was boring and uninteresting, then I would have to lie awake every night for the rest of my life wondering “What if?” What if I had taken the test again and passed? Would I then be in the job that I really wanted? That was not a situation I wanted to be in. I did not want to live the rest of my life regretting what might have been.

This is the first time I've felt what I feel put down so accurately into words. This is the closest passage I've found to explaining my motivations behind why I want to get a PhD.
